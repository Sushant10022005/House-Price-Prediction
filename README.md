# House Price Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques, specifically **Linear Regression** and **Gradient Boosting Regressor**. It utilizes a dataset containing house sale records to train models that can estimate house prices based on various features.

## Features
- **Data Processing:** Cleans and preprocesses raw house sale data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzes trends and patterns in house prices.
- **Model Training:** Implements Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting for price prediction.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assesses model accuracy using performance metrics.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data processing and manipulation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data visualization)
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine learning models)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (For interactive development)

## Dataset
The dataset used is `kc_house_data.csv`, which contains house sale records with various features such as bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, and price.
